            <img src="images/600wins.jpg" alt="newsimage"> <!-- img to the news -->
            <p>Manchester United have regularly set impressive new benchmarks for other teams to follow during our illustrious history. The Reds became the first club in the Premier League era to amass a total of 2,000 points in last month’s 2-0 home win over Watford. And United reached another unprecedented milestone on Sunday after beating Middlesbrough 3-1 at the Riverside Stadium, on our first trip to Teesside since 2009. <br><br> Jose Mourinho’s men have now become the first of the 47 teams to play in the Premier League to chalk up 600 wins. The historic victory came in our 951st match since its inception in 1992/93, with the overall record also including 204 draws and 147 defeats.<br><br>Here is a statistical breakdown of how the Reds have achieved the significant landmark:<br> <br>On home soil and on the road:<br> Home wins: 346<br>Away wins: 254<br><br>Top five teams United have beaten the most:<br>Aston Villa – 34<br>Everton – 33<br>Tottenham Hotspur – 32<br>Liverpool – 27<br>West Ham United – 26<br><br>Manager by manager:<br>Sir Alex Ferguson – 528 wins (from 810 games)<br>Louis van Gaal – 39 wins (from 76 games)<br>David Moyes – 17 wins (from 34 games)<br>Jose Mourinho – 14 wins (from 27 games)<br>Ryan Giggs – 2 wins (from 4 games)<br><br>Biggest victories:<br>04/03/95 – United 9 Ipswich Town 0 (Old Trafford)<br>06/02/99 – Nottingham Forest 1 United 8 (City Ground)<br>28/08/11 – United 8 Arsenal 2 (Old Trafford)<br>25/10/97 – United 7 Barnsley 0 (Old Trafford)<br>12/01/08 – United 6 Newcastle 0 (Old Trafford)<br><br>Top five most popular winning scorelines (home and away):<br>1-0 win – 118  <br>2-0 win – 111<br>2-1 win – 93<br>3-0 win – 65<br>3-1 win – 56<br><br>Top three scorers in Premier League wins:<br>Wayne Rooney – 163  <br>Ryan Giggs – 92<br>Paul Scholes – 90</p>

            <h3><strong>ROAD TO STOCKHOLM:</strong> Manchester United drawn with Belgian giants Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-finals </h3> <!-- title of news -->
            <img src="images/europe.jpg" alt="newsimage"> <!-- img to the news -->
            <p>MANCHESTER UNITED will face Belgian giants Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-finals. Jose Mourinho’s side will play the first-leg away on Thursday April 13, with the return tie a week later.<br><br>The Red Devils recorded their biggest-ever European win against Anderlecht way back in September 1956. United thrashed them 10-0 in a European Cup preliminary round tie – but the chances of history repeating itself look slim. Mourinho will have to ensure his men are on top form to stop star man Youri Tielemans. The 19-year-old midfielder has already attracted the attentions of a number of big clubs across the continent and won his first cap for Belgium last year.<br><br>United sealed their spot in the last eight with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Russian side FC Rostov. Juan Mata’s second half strike at Old Trafford on Thursday secured a 1-0 win to send them through following the 1-1 draw in the first leg. The victory, however, came at a heavy price as two of the Premier League club’s key men suffered injuries.<br><br>World-record signing Paul Pogba and defender Daley Blind both limped off during the clash and could be a doubt for the quarters. The Europa League final will be played in Stockholm at the Friends Arena on Wednesday May 24, with the victors landing a spot in next year’s Champions League.</p>

            <h3>MU Foundation still going strong 10 years on</h3> <!-- title of news -->
            <img src="images/newimage.jpg" alt="newsimage"> <!-- img to the news -->
            <p>From organising player visits and Santa Runs to working closely with local schools, Manchester United Foundation has helped to change the lives of many young people for the better.This month marks the tenth anniversary of the Foundation, which uses football to engage, inspire and unite youngsters through coaching, educational programmes and personal development.<br><br>The Foundation was formed after a Uefa Celebration Match in March 2007, honouring 50 years of the Reds’ participation in European competition. A United side featuring legends Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo took on a Europe XI, which included current Reds striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Steven Gerrard and Andrea Pirlo, with proceeds going towards setting up the club’s charitable arm.<br><br>A decade on, the Foundation has since established a wide presence across Greater Manchester and is currently working with more than 20,000 young people of all different ages and abilities on a series of regular projects.Since 2014, an innovative Partner Schools programme has more than doubled in size, with full-time coaches now based in 20 high schools across the city.<br><br>The Manchester United Enterprise Academy continues to provide students with an insight into what it takes for the club to be as successful off the pitch as it is on the field from a business perspective through fun and practical workshops.Funded by the Premier League, the Street Reds project is the Foundation’s flagship community cohesion programme, offering young people the opportunity to pursue their interest in playing, leading and coaching football in 12 different locations.<br><br>One of the Foundation’s main aims is getting youngsters prepared for later life and Volunteer Ninety Nine is designed to provide training, recognised qualifications and work experience for 16 to 21-year-olds interested in a career in sport.While, throughout 2017, the Foundation is putting its participants in the global spotlight to tell their stories of the positive benefits the charity has made to them in a special #UnitedandMe campaign.<br><br>United’s senior stars have engaged in many Foundation activities over the years and, most recently, the current first-team saw the impact the charity has had on the lives of local children at this year’s annual #SchoolsUnited events. Chris Smalling has been a huge supporter of the Foundation since joining the club in 2010 and feels the players are in a privileged position to make a difference to young people.<br><br>“We’re lucky to be able to participate in a lot of the Foundation’s work,” the defender said. “I know when I was in school if I had a footballer come down and have a kick about, I would probably have about 10 questions written down ready to fire away at them!“So, it’s nice to be able to do something that means so much and can give them inspiration for the rest of their education.”<br><br>Richard Arnold, chairman of the Foundation and Manchester United’s managing director, said: “The Foundation allows us to connect with our communities in Manchester, with the youth of Manchester, in the schools that we partner with and our projects in the evenings, connecting with kids and their parents.“The world is our oyster; there’s a huge possibility for us to reach out and grow and I know the Foundation has huge ambition and huge goals for the future."<br><br>"A documentary to celebrate the anniversary can be seen in full on the Foundation’s YouTube channel. During the 45-minute programme, former players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Robin van Persie visit Foundation partner schools, projects and hospitals, whilst legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson puts smiles on faces at an annual Dream Day. “The Foundation epitomises Manchester United’s care for the rest of Manchester,” Sir Alex said. “It has played a great part in terms of educating young people and charity work so I really have to say well done to them because it still there and it’s still doing very well.”</p>

            <h3>Mourinho calls for killer instinct</h3> <!-- title of news -->
            <img src="images/jose.jpg" alt="newsimage"> <!-- img to the news -->
            <p>Jose Mourinho says his Manchester United players have to work on killing teams off after the Reds were held once again this season at Old Trafford. The 0-0 stalemate with West Brom was the eighth draw in 15 Premier League home games this term, even if the unbeaten run in the league has stretched to 19 matches.<br><br> The United manager spoke of his frustration at his team's lack of a killer instinct in front of goal, insisting an inability to be consistent in the scoring stakes is continuing to prove costly.<br><br>"I think in football, especially in teams that want to win things, you need consistency in the individuals," he said. "In some other clubs and some teams where you play for a top-10 place, a player with talent is always welcome even if it that talent is not consistent and that talent is one day yes, one day no. In teams at this level you need to be consistent. "We need to kill opponents off and this is déjà vu all season. When you score a goal against these teams, you don’t win 1-0, you win 3-0 or 4-0 because, when you score, the game is open and you have a completely different story because then they have to play a different way.<br><br> "We are not consistent with this, we miss easy chances, we have moments or periods where we push but then a couple of players disappear and there is 10 minutes when you don’t see them. You see always the same people, always the same guys in front of the train, pulling the train. So it’s disappointing, yes, because it’s one more draw. It’s an amazing unbeaten run though - 19 matches in the modern-day Premier League, it’s fantastic, but we've had too many draws at home. Some draws away from home are very acceptable or positive and we can deal with it, but too many draws at home."  <br><br>Asked whether he thinks his players find it easier to play away home, Mourinho declared: "I still think playing away from home is more difficult to have total control of the game because opponents at home play a different way. Their supporters push them for a different kind of football and I still feel that away from home is difficult."If you ask me if  I prefer to play West Brom at home or prefer to go to their stadium, I prefer to play here, no doubt about it. But we need to kill opponents. You see the number of goals we score in relation to our production and dominance and it’s a big contradiction. "The number of goals we score at home probably if someone who doesn’t know looks at them they may think we are a defensive team, we are a counter-attacking team waiting for a mistake, that we don’t push, we don’t control things and we don’t have a mission and that’s completely the opposite.<br><br> "But you see how many goals our guys score – [Marcus] Rashford, [Jesse] Lingard, [Henrikh] Mkhitaryan, [Anthony] Martial – you see how many goals they score and then Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] and [Juan] Mata are the ones with more goals. Zlatan, for sure, and I think Mata will come after him. If they are not [playing], then the situation gets even more difficult."</p>

            <h3>Loan Watch: Young Reds make progress </h3> <!-- title of news -->
            <img src="images/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="newsimage"> <!-- img to the news -->
            <p><strong>Nine young Manchester United players have spent time out on loan this season.</strong> <br>Andreas Pereira, Guillermo Varela, Sam Johnstone and Adnan Januzaj remain with their temporary clubs, while Dean Henderson, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Joe Riley, Joel Pereira and James Wilson have now returned to the Reds after brief spells elsewhere. With the latest international break now upon us, ManUtd.com has caught up with their progress in 2016/17. Read about how the Reds starlets have fared away from Old Trafford so far this term…<br><br><strong>Andreas Pereira</strong><br>After scoring in Jose Mourinho’s first official game against Wigan last summer, the midfielder was loaned to Granada in Spain but, despite the Andalusian side’s struggles at the bottom of La Liga, he has enjoyed a positive campaign of development thus far. The Brazilian’s stunning winner against Las Palmas in January, one of four goals he has scored to date, was likened to his legendary fellow countryman Ronaldinho. It was one of many disciplined and mature performances this season from the 21-year-old, who has excelled as a box-to-box player but has mainly operated as a left-winger under new Granada coach Lucas Alcaraz. Benefitting from regular football, Pereira has been the most ever-present outfield player for Granada, despite serving a ban following his red card against Real Betis last month, and will return the Reds with the confidence that he can challenge for a place in the Reds’ first-team.<br><br><strong>Guillermo Varela</strong><br>The first man to leave the Reds on a temporary basis last summer, the Uruguayan quickly made a favourable impression at German club Eintracht Frankfurt and made the right-back berth his own, before unfortunately being sidelined for five months last September with ankle ligament damage. Despite that setback, the 23-year-old, who appeared four times for the Reds last season, made a successful return to the side last month in a 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga.<br><br><strong>Sam Johnstone</strong><br>The talented young goalkeeper has featured in several first-team squads for the Reds but, such has been the imperious form of David De Gea and Sergio Romero, he still awaits his full debut for United. Since the turn of the year, the 23-year-old has been at Championship side Aston Villa, under the stewardship of former Reds stalwart Steve Bruce. Johnstone has since established himself as the number one stopper at Villa Park and put in a Man-of-the-Match display in last weekend’s 2-0 win at Wigan, making several impressive saves. It led to high praise from Bruce, who said afterwards: "He’s progressing week by week. He’s a young player who we brought into the club and he can only get better."  <br><br><strong>Adnan Januzaj</strong><br>Having burst onto the scene in a United shirt with a brace on his first start for the club in 2013 at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, the promising winger made Wearside his temporary home last summer and was reunited with former Reds boss David Moyes. It didn’t take long for the Belgian to make an impact, scoring a late winner in a 1-0 victory over Shrewsbury in the EFL Cup on only his third appearance for the Black Cats. An ankle injury, sustained against Crystal Palace in September, sidelined him for six weeks but the 22-year-old has made good progress since his return and caught the eye in a goalless draw against Burnley last weekend, going close to scoring on a number of occasions.<br><br><strong>Cameron Borthwick-Jackson</strong><br>After signing a new contract with the Reds at the end of the season, the Academy product joined Wolves on loan at the start of this term. The 20-year-old made a bright start to his spell at Molineux, making seven appearances in all competitions for the Championship side, before returning to Old Trafford earlier this month. The left-back has since been a regular for the Reserves, playing in the last three games for Nicky Butt’s team.<br><br><strong>Joe Riley</strong><br>The defender joined Sheffield United in January but, although Blades boss Chris Wilder believed he could play a pivotal role in the run-in for the promotion-chasing League One side, the 20-year-old could only make two appearances before his spell at Bramall Lane was cut short because of a shoulder injury. The left-back, who appeared as a substitute against Shrewsbury and started the 5-1 win over Midtjylland in the Europa League for the Reds last season, has been a consistent performer for the Reserves but will now be bidding to become a regular figure on the first-team scene.  <br><br><strong>Joel Pereira</strong><br>The 20-year-old, who was part of Portugal’s squad for last summer’s Olympic Games in Rio, returned to his home country to join Belenenses on a temporary basis on deadline day last summer. But his spell at the Lisbon-based club came to an end in January as the Swiss-born stopper was recalled by the Reds to provide back-up following Sam Johnstone’s move to Aston Villa. Pereira, who has previously captained the Under 21s and spent time on loan at League One club Rochdale, made his first-team debut for United as a substitute in the 4-0 win over Wigan in the Emirates FA Cup, replacing Romero for the final 10 minutes of the game.<br><br><strong>Dean Henderson</strong><br>After catching the eye on loan at National League North club Stockport County last season, the England Under-20 international attracted the interest of League Two newcomers Grimsby Town and made his debut on Boxing Day in a 2-0 win over Accrington Stanley. But after seven impressive games for the Mariners, in which he kept four clean sheets, the stopper was recalled by the Reds last month to provide extra cover between the sticks following the injury to Joel Pereira.<br><br><strong>James Wilson</strong><br>After a fruitful stint at Brighton and Hove Albion towards the end of last season, which yielded five goals, the former England Under-21 international made the move to fellow Championship side Derby County at the start of the current campaign. But, unfortunately for the striker, it ended prematurely after making just four appearances for the Rams, after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament knee injury, and Wilson returned to Old Trafford in October to undergo an operation.</p>
